<!-- READ THIS FIRST

Hello, thanks for taking the time to report a bug!

Before you proceed, please verify that you're running the latest version of SimpleTradeSkillExporter. The easiest way to do this is via the Curseforge client, but you can also download the latest version here: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simple-trade-skill-exporter

SimpleTradeSkillExporter is currently maintained by a single developer using code from a prior developer. It is currently only tested in Cataclysm Classic with plans to add Classic / Season of Discovery. There are no plans to add Retail at this time due to signifigant refactoring that would need to take place.
