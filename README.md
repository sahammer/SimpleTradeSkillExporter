# Overview
This addon allows you to export your learned trade skills and share them via text, markdown or import into a spreadsheet using comma separated values. Originally inspired from TradeSkillExporter and created with permission from GrumpyOldLisian.

Simple output will just output the names of the recipes, whereas Markdown or CSV will export with WOWHead links attached.

Currently only tested in Cataclysm Classic, planning on testing in other versions as well. Also planning to create a project in GitHub to support community contributions.

## Usage

Open any trade skill window and type `/tsexport`

Use CTRL-C to copy the trade skill list and paste them in your desired location.

By default `/tsexport` will export a simple list. Other options available are:

`/tsexport markdown` to export a markdown formatted list.

`/tsexport csv` to export comma separated values for import into a spreadsheet.
